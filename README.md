# BioPredict: Unraveling Patterns of Endangerment for National Park Species

## Project Scope
This project addresses the critical decline in biodiversity within national parks, a challenge impacting environmental health and community well-being. Utilizing species data from four national parks, I analyzed patterns in species endangerment to develop predictive models. The aim is to enhance biodiversity monitoring and facilitate proactive conservation efforts.

## Problem
The decline in biodiversity within national parks poses significant environmental, economic, and cultural threats. It is essential to identify and protect endangered species within these parks to maintain ecological balance.

## Impact
This issue affects environmentalists, park authorities, tourists, and local communities. A loss in biodiversity can result in ecosystem imbalances, impacting all who rely on these ecosystems.

## Current Solutions & Gaps
Existing solutions include manual species tracking and limited technological tools. Gaps exist in comprehensive data collection, real-time monitoring, and predictive analysis, which are crucial for proactive conservation measures.

## Goals
The primary goals are:
- To identify patterns in species becoming endangered in national parks.
- To predict which species are most at risk.

## Data
Historical records of 5,541 species across 4 national parks, detailing species name, category, and conservation status. Additionally, 23,296 recent observations within the parks.

## Analysis
The project involves descriptive analysis, data visualizations, and predictive modeling to identify at-risk species. Key metrics analyzed include species distributions, conservation status, and species observations in parks.

## Questions Guiding Analysis
- Distribution and significance of conservation status among species.
- Likelihood of different species types being endangered.
- Correlations between protected plant and animal sightings.

## Findings
Key insights include:
- Majority of species are not under conservation.
- Significant differences in conservation status among different species types.
- Strong correlation between protected plant and animal sightings.

## Recommendations
- Implementation of predictive models for conservation.
- Strategies for effective conservation based on findings.
- Further research into the impact of endangered plant species on animal species.

## Further Research
Exploring changes over time in species conservation status, assessing park area impacts on biodiversity, and studying spatial distribution of species.

## Ethical Considerations
This project strictly adheres to ethical guidelines, ensuring data privacy and responsible use of information.
